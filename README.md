Inspired by the
[Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)
methodology and Ben Solo's iconic shirtless scene, Swolo is a cross-platform
**project management and note-taking app** designed for a party of one.

Capture tasks, manage projects, and take notes with confidence â€” just like Ben,
you're swol enough to handle anything your workload throws at you.
